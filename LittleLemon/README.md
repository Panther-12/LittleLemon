# Assignment Review Notice: Modified Django Routes

Dear Reviewers,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you that some of the Django routes provided in the assignment have been modified for improved functionality and efficiency. Below is a summary of the changes made:

## Summary of Modified Routes

1. **/bookings/**
   - Description: The route for retrieving all bookings and updating reservation slots.
   - Changes: Switched to just fetch all bookings and the task of updating reservation slots given the route ***/update-slots/***.

2. **/bookings?date**
   - Description: The route for fetching bookings on a specific date posts.
   - Changes: Enhanced to fetch the date as a path variable rather than a query parameter.

3. **/book/**
   - Description: The route used to display the book form and create new bookings.
   - Changes: Assigned to only display the book page and creating new bookings assigned ***/update-slots/***.

## Rationale for Modifications

The decision to modify these routes was driven by the desire to enhance the overall performance, security, and user experience of the application. We thoroughly tested the changes to ensure they do not introduce any unintended side effects.

## Testing

Extensive testing has been conducted on the modified routes to verify their correctness and stability. We performed unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to cover various scenarios.


## Conclusion

We believe that the changes made to the Django routes have significantly improved the application's performance and security. However, we kindly request you to review the modifications and provide your valuable feedback. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us.

Thank you for your time and consideration in reviewing our assignment. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
